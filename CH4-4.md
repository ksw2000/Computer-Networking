# Chapter4-4 Generalized Forward and SDN

Each router contains a flow table that is computed and distributed by a *logically centralized* routing controller.

## OpenFlow data plane abstraction

Flow: defined by header fields

Generalized forwarding: simple packet-handling rules

+ **Pattern**: match values in header fields

+ **Actions for matched packet**: drop, forward, modify, matched packet or send matched packet to controller

+ **Priority**: disambiguate overlapping patterns

+ **Counters**: \#bytes and \#packets

## OpenFlow abstraction

> match + action: unifies different kinds of devices

1. Router
   
   + match: longest destination IP prefix
   
   + action: forward out a link

2. Switch
   
   + match: longest destination MAC address
   
   + action: forward or flood

3. Firewall
   
   + match: IP addresses and TCP/UDP port numbers
   
   + action: permit or deny

4. NAT
   
   + match: IP address and port
   
   + action: rewrite address and port
